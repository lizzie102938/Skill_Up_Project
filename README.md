<h1 align="center">Welcome to Skill-Up! </h1> 

<h2 align="center">Teach your skills, earn points and learn new skills for free</h2>

This application was built for our final project at the Le Wagon bootcamp in Berlin, March 2022. With this application we used Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Stimulus, PostreSQL, CSS, HTML, SASS and deployed it to Heroku. üíª Take a look! http://www.skill-up.xyz/ (for access to all features, please use log in:

<h4>üí° Purpose:</h4>
Skill-Up is an application which was designed to help users to connect with others to teach and learn new skills. The act of teaching earns a user points, which they can then use in exchange for lessons from others. More on <a href="http://www.skill-up.xyz/how_it_works" target="_blank">how it works.</a>

<h4>üèπ Target:</h4>
Users who are curious to learn new things, meet new people and are happy to share their passions with others. 

<h4>‚úÖ  Solution:</h4>
Create a network of people who can benefit from free learning by simply sharing their talents with others. Lessons can take place in person or remote, allowing access across the globe.

<h4>üí° Originality:</h4>
No other app allows users to exchange skills for free. The removal of any monetary exchange instils a feeling of community spirit.
